The following chapters cover all things security-related in Xataface.

=== API Authentication

Xataface provides a REST API for authentication so that you can access your application using a REST client.  When using this API, you'll perform a request to the "login" action to obtain an authentication token.  You can then make authenticated requests to your app by adding this token in the Authorization header as a bearer token.

==== Login

To log in using the API, simply perform a POST request to `?-action=login&--no-prompt=1`

1. `UserName` - The username to log in with.
2. `Password` - The password to log in with.

If login succeeds, you'll receive a JSON response with a token.  E.g.

[source,json]
----
{
  "code":200,
  "token":"576646...2dDRuOGUycGI=",
  "message":"Logged in"
}
----

An unsuccessful login will look something like:

[source,json]
----
{"code":500,"message":"No UserName provided."}

==== Making Authenticated Requests

Once you have obtained a token, you should include this token in the `Authorization` header of HTTP requests.  E.g.

[source,bash]
----
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' https://example.com?index.php
----

But replace `{TOKEN}` with your token received during login.

==== Logging Out

To log out, simply perform a POST or GET request to `?-action=logout&--no-prompt=1`
