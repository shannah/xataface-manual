== HTTP Request Handling

The following sections include tips for configuring how Xataface applications respond to HTTP requests.  This includes topics such as event routing, response types, etc...

=== Specifying a Default Action

[discrete]
==== Problem

You want your application to use a default action other than the Xataface default, if the user doesn't explicitly provide an "-action" parameter.

[discrete]
==== Solution

Use the `default_action` conf.ini directive.

E.g.:

.Setting a default action at the beginning of your conf.ini file.
[source,ini]
----
default_action=find
----

This would result in the user being directed to the "find" action by default.

NOTE: If "default_action" is not specified, then Xataface will use the "list" action as the default.

=== Using Different Default Action Depending on Table

[discrete]
==== Problem

You want to specify a default action only for one table in your application.  The "default_action" conf.ini directive sets the default action application-wide.

[discrete]
==== Solution

Use the `default_action.tablename` directive in your conf.ini file.  (`tablename` should be replaced with your desired table name.  For example, suppose I want to make the "view" action the default action for the "posts" table, then I would define the following at the beginning of the conf.ini file:

[source,ini]
----
default_action.posts=view
----

=== Specifying Default Query Parameters for Default Actions

[discrete]
==== Problem

You want to supply additional query parameters for your default actions.  These parameters should only be applied when the default action is used.

[discrete]
==== Solution

Use the `default_params.tablename` directive.  E.g.

.Setting some default query parameters for when the default action is used on the posts table.
[source,ini]
----
default_action.posts=view
default_params.posts="post_id=2&foo=bar"
----

These default parameters will be used if the user requests a URL like:

----
index.php?-table=posts
----

The above would effectively be the same as:

----
index.php?-table=posts&-action=view&post_id&foo=bar
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `default_params.tablename` directive only applies when the default action is being used.  E.g. In the above example, if the user requests:

----
index.php?-table=posts&-action=view
----

The default params would not be applied because the "-action" has been specified explicitly by the user.
====

The above example shows the `default_params.posts` directive specified as a URL-encoded string.  However, you can also define the parameters as a section.

E.g.

[source,ini]
----
[default_params.posts]
  post_id=2
  foo=bar
----

This would be equivalent to 

[source,ini]
----
default_params.posts="post_id=2&foo=bar"
----

=== Showing the "Edit" Tab By Default for Record Details

[discrete]
==== Problem

By default, when the user clicks on a record to see its details, they will be shown the "View" tab.  You want to show them the "Edit" tab instead.

[discrete]
==== Solution

Use the `default_browse_action` directive of the conf.ini file. This directive is analagous to the `default_action` directive, except it is only applied when the user requests the "browse" action, which is the default action used for displaying record details.

The direct solution to our problem would be the following at the beginning of the conf.ini file.

[source,ini]
----
default_browse_action=edit
----

[TIP]
====
Just like the `default_action` directive, you can specify a different default browse action for different tables using the `default_browse_action.tablename` directive.  E.g.

.Only setting the default browse action to edit on the "posts" table.
[source,ini]
----
default_browse_action.posts=edit
----
====

=== Setting Default Query Parameters for the `browse` Action

[discrete]
==== Problem

You have specified a custom action that you are using as the default "browse" action for your table via the `default_browse_action.mytable=myaction` directive.  However your action requires some additional query parameters to work correctly.  You need to add these default parameters somehow.

[discrete]
==== Solution

Use the `default_browse_params.tablename` directive to add parameters to the `browse` action. This directive works similarly to the `default_params.tablename` directive.  E.g. Let's add a "foo" query parameter by default when the user accesses the "browse" action on the "posts" table.

[source,ini]
----
default_browse_action.posts=myaction
default_browse_params.posts="foo=bar"
----

[TIP]
====
The above example shows the `default_browse_params.posts` directive specified as a URL-encoded string.  However, you can also define the parameters as a section.

E.g.

[source,ini]
----
[default_browse_params.posts]
  foo=bar
  fuzz=bazz
----

This would be equivalent to 

[source,ini]
----
default_browse_params.posts="foo=bar&fuzz=bazz"
----
====


=== Setting a Related Records Tab as the Default Browse Action

[discrete]
==== Problem

When the user clicks on a record in the "list" view, you want them to see a related record tab instead of the "View" tab by default.

[discrete]
==== Solution

We can achieve this by way of the `default_browse_params.tablename` conf.ini directives.  For example, suppose we wanted to show the "authors" relationship of the "posts" table by default when a post's details are shown:

.Specifying that the "authors" relationship should be shown by default when viewing a record in the posts table.
[source,ini]
----
default_browse_params.posts="-relationship=authors"
----

Notice here, that we didn't actually need to use the `default_browse_action` parameter to specify that it should use the `related_records_list` action (which is the action used to display a related list).  Xataface infers this by the presence of the "-relationship" directive.
