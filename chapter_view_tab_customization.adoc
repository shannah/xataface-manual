== _View_ Tab Customization

The following sections form a sort of cook book with recipes for customizing the _view_ tab, also known as the _Details_ tab.  This is the tab in the UI that shows the details of a single record.

=== Displaying Synthetic/Calculated Field

[discrete]
==== Problem

You want to create a _synthetic_ field, and display it in the _view_ tab just as you would with all of the regular fields.

[discrete]
==== Solution

. Define your synthetic field in your table's delegate class using the `field__` prefix.  E.g.
+
[source,php]
----
function field__mycustomfield(Dataface_Record $record) {
    return "My custom field value";
}
----
. Add an entry to the _fields.ini_ file for this field, and set `visibility:browse=visible`:
+
[source,ini]
----
[mycustomfield]
    visibility:browse=visible
----

==== Example

https://www.tuxpin.com[Tuxpin] includes a _podcasts_ table that allows users to create their own podcast.  Each podcast has a unique ID, which is stored in the _podcast_uuid_ column.  It also provides a website for the podcast, which is located at a URL of the form:

_https://podcasts.tuxpin.com/{podcast_uuid}_

Beause the website URL can be derived from the _podcast_uuid_, we don't need to actually store it in the database.  However, we would like to display this URL in the View tab.

To achieve this, we first define the _website_url_ field in the delegate class as follows:

[source,php]
----
function field__website_url(Dataface_Record $record) {
    return 'https://podcasts.tuxpin.com/' . $record->val('podcast_uuid').'/';
}
----

By default synthetic (or calculated) fields are not displayed in the view tab (or anywhere in the UI, for that matter).  You need to set the `visibility:browse` property of the field to `visible`, in order to have it appear in the view tab.

So, in the table's _fields.ini_ file we add:

[source,ini]
----
[website_url]
    visibility:browse=visible
    group=website    ; Tell it to display this field in the website fieldgroup

----


And the result:

We can now treat this field like any other field in our view tab.  We can further customize using configuration options and delegate class methods, just as we would with a _real_ field.
