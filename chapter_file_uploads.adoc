=== Specifying Content Disposition of File Download

[discrete]
==== Problem

By default the contents of `blob` fields and container fields are downloaded as a file download in the browser.  You want the browser to navigate to the file instead of downloading it.

[discrete]
==== Solution

Use the `contentDisposition=inline` fields.ini directive.

[source,ini]
----
[myfield]
    contentDisposition=inline
----

Now, when users click on the link for this field, the browser will navigate to the field content.

TIP: The `contentDisposition` directive will be used to set the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header.  Learn more about this header https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition[here].
