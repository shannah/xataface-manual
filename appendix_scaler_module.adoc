== Scaler Module

The https://github.com/shannah/xataface-module-scaler[Scaler Module] provides a flexible and robust caching solution that will allow your application to handle much heavier loads than usual.  It uses the https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcache.php[PHP Memcache] extension to cache output in memory.

If you expect your application to receive heavy loads, then you should seriously consider using this module to help the application scale.

See the see the https://github.com/shannah/xataface-module-scaler/blob/master/README.adoc[Scaler module README file] for more information.
