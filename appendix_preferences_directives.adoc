=== How to Set Preferences

Xataface preferences can be defined in 4 ways:

. In the `[_prefs]` section of the conf.ini file for global static preferences.
. Implementing the `getPreferences()` method in the Application Delegate Class
. In the `__prefs__` section of the fields.ini file for a table for static preferences on that table. (Limited to only certain preferences).
. Using the `prefs.key` fields.ini directive on fields of the users table to specify that the value of that field should be used as a preference for the currently logged in user.

.Example [_prefs] section in the conf.ini
[source,ini]
----
[_prefs]
    hide_updated=1
    hide_posted_by=1
----

.Example getPreferences? method in the Application Delegate Class:
[source,ini]
----
function getPreferences(){
    return array('hide_update'=>1, 'hide_posted_by'=>1);

}
